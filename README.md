# Book-recommendation-system
This project is a book recommender system that involves the complete process from exploratory data analysis to feature engineering and model development. The project utilizes Flask for model deployment, with a user-friendly interface created using HTML and CSS. The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle, and all the backend work is performed inside Jupyter Notebook.
## Project Structure
### The project structure is organized as follows:

- app.py: The Flask application file responsible for handling HTTP requests and rendering HTML templates.
- templates/: This directory contains the HTML templates used for the user interface.
- static/css/: CSS files for styling the HTML templates.
- model development/: Jupyter Notebooks used for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.
- data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset)

## Usage
Once the project is up and running, follow the instructions provided on the web interface to interact with the book recommender system. Enter your preferences or search criteria, and the system will recommend books based on your inputs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about books, such as title, author, genre, and user ratings. The dataset has been preprocessed and used for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and training the recommender system.
